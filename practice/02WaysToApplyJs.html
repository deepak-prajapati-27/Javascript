    <h1>Ways To Apply Js</h1>
    <p>There are 3 ways to apply.</p>
    <p>
      1. Just before the closing tag of head. And there we can only give link of
      the javascript page.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Just before the closing of body tag. Here we can write internal js.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Just before the closing of body tag. here we can give link of the
      javascript page.
    </p>

    <h3>NOTE:</h3>
    <p>
      If we give the link before the closing tag of the head , then the
      javascript will load first and then the html and css.
    </p>
    <p>For small javascript we can use internal javascript.</p>
    <p>
      We should use the 3rd way to apply javascript because javascript will load
      after the html and css, it will not take load.
